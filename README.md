<h2>Project Description:</h2>
<p>This project is a serverless to-do list application built with React and integrated with Google Authentication. Leveraging Firebase for authentication and database management, the application offers a seamless user experience. Users can log in using their Google accounts, create tasks with deadlines, mark tasks as complete, and easily delete tasks. With its React framework, the application provides an intuitive interface for efficient task management. Experience the power of Google Authentication, Firebase, and React in this user-friendly to-do list solution.</p>

<h2>Motivation:</h2>
<p>My motivation for this project stemmed from my experiences as a university student and my passion for coding. As I embarked on my journey to learn React and Firebase, I sought an opportunity to apply and reinforce my newly acquired skills. Combining these technologies, I envisioned creating an application that could assist me in managing my university-related tasks effectively. This project became a way for me to leverage my knowledge, hone my programming abilities, and develop a practical solution that would benefit not only myself but also other students facing similar challenges.</p>

<h2>Difficulties Encountered and Lessons Learnt:</h2>
<p>Throughout this project, I encountered several challenges that ultimately contributed to my growth as a developer. One major difficulty I faced was gaining a solid understanding of how React operates. Initially, I struggled with implementing authentication because I lacked a fundamental comprehension of how React refreshes after every state change. Consequently, I found it challenging to figure out how to refresh the page after a user signed in and persist that state. Additionally, incorporating the useEffect hook for the first time presented its own set of obstacles. Nevertheless, these challenges served as valuable learning opportunities, allowing me to delve deeper into React's inner workings and expand my knowledge of essential concepts like state management and lifecycle methods. Overcoming these difficulties not only enhanced my understanding of React but also bolstered my problem-solving skills as a developer.</p>
